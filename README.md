## Reddit Agent

Fetch posts from a Reddit sub and analyze them with AI.

### Why?

**Scenario:** Market Research for a New Product Launch

**Context:** Imagine a company, "TechInnovate," is developing a new noise-canceling headphone designed specifically for gamers. They want to understand the current sentiment and needs of their target audience (gamers) before launching the product. Rather than relying on assumptions or expensive surveys, they decide to leverage the vast, real-time data available on Reddit.

### Usage

1.  **Configuration:** Add check env.example for needed API keys. e.g RapidAPI and OpenAI/Google. Also configure prompts as queries you need to be passed to the agent. Configure/Change Agent instructions to your own liking.
2.  **Execution:** Pull repo and install packages e.g bun install then run bunx/npx mastra dev. Navigate to localhost:4111 and either use the defined workflow or just ask the bot. The Agent is configured to use an MCP server to save your data to spreadsheets. You will need to authenticate this.
3.  **Output:** The agent will either save your data on spreadsheets, a local file (under the .mastra folder). Output can also be viewed through the terminal
